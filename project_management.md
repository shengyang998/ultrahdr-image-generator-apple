## Technical Decisions

### Architecture Decisions

| ID | Decision | Context | Alternatives Considered | Date |
|----|----------|---------|-------------------------|------|
| AD-1 | Modular architecture with separation between UI and processing layers | Need for clean separation of concerns and potential for code reuse | Monolithic design | - |
| AD-2 | SwiftUI for user interface | Modern declarative UI framework with better support for multiplatform | UIKit/AppKit | - |
| AD-3 | C++ wrapper for libultrahdr | Efficient bridging to the C++ library | Direct FFI calls | - |

### Implementation Challenges

| ID | Challenge | Description | Status | Resolution |
|----|-----------|-------------|--------|------------|
| IC-1 | CIImage HDR extraction | Extracting proper HDR data from CIImage | Open | - |
| IC-2 | libultrahdr integration | Integrating C++ library into Swift project | Open | - |
| IC-3 | Memory management | Handling large image data efficiently | Open | - |
